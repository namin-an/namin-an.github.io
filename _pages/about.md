Creative. Dilligent. Motivated. Open-Minded. Resourceful.

These are the attributes that I keep in mind in order to become a successful AI researcher. I believe that AI would make the world a better place, assisting humans to perform various tasks such as replacing humans in time-consuming and cost-expensive experiments, which is related to the first research topic that I have encountered while working at <a href='https://imvisionlab.com/'>Im Lab</a>. Since March 2023, I have become a full-time graduate student at <a href='https://xfact.net/'>XFact Lab</a>, exploring to what extent the state-of-the-art large language models could truly understand the human language and whether they could represent the human population.

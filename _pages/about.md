Creativity. Dilligent. Reliable. Resourceful. Thoughtful.

These are the attributes that I always try to keep in mind in order to become a successful researcher. Besides the work-related talk, I love to sing (🎤) and play instruments (🎹, 🎻, 🎸). Yoga/pilates (🧘🏻‍♀️) make me relaxed, and I'm into hiking (🧗🏻‍♀️) and playing tennis (🎾) nowadays.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Creative. Dilligent. Motivated. Open-Minded. Resourceful.

These are the attributes that I keep in mind in order to become a successful AI researcher. I believe that AI can assist humans to perform various tasks like simulating visual prosthetic devices for visually impaired people. This is my first research topic while working at <a href='https://imvisionlab.com/'>Im Lab</a> as an intern with supportive advisor <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jidhBw0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Maesoon Im</a>.

Since March 2023, I became a full-time graduate student at <a href='https://xfact.net/'>XFact Lab</a> co-adviced by encouraging <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hao9RrgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>James Thorne</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KB5XZGIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Kate Shim</a>. I am excited to visit <a href='https://www.copenlu.com/'>CopeNLU</a> starting March 2025 to collaborate with <a href='https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DjJp0dcAAAAJ&hl'>Isabelle Augenstein</a>.
